# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI Second Brain - a personal knowledge management system that combines the simplicity of Markdown with the intelligence of AI. Built using Claude Code as your intelligent layer for continuous updates, insights, and organization.

**Philosophy**: Everything in one place, with AI as your intelligent layer. Start simple (journal) and expand organically into your Personal Operating System.

## Session Initialization Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: At the start of every new session, you should automatically:

1. **Check the current date and time** using `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` to understand the time of day
2. **Identify which module the user wants to work with** (default to journal if unclear)
3. **For Journal Module**:
   - Check if today's journal entry exists in `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Review the last 2-3 entries to understand ongoing themes, situations, and reflections
   - Use this context to start meaningful conversations about what's happening
   - Create or open today's entry (if file doesn't exist, create with basic structure)
   - Engage in conversation with appropriate time-of-day greetings
   - Reference recent events or themes from previous entries to create continuity
4. **General conversation principles**:
   - Ask only ONE question at a time to keep conversations focused and natural
   - Wait for response before asking follow-up questions
   - Be genuinely curious and supportive

## Continuous Update Workflow

**CRITICAL**: After every user message/response, you should:

1. **Update the relevant files** with new information, insights, or reflections from the conversation
2. **Be thoughtful about organization** - add content to appropriate sections/files
3. **Update this CLAUDE.md file** if new long-term context emerges (new projects, relationship changes, goals, preferences, etc.)
4. **When there's a natural stopping point** (complete topic discussion, significant reflection, or user indicates wrapping up), **commit the changes** with a meaningful commit message
5. **Continue the conversation** naturally while maintaining this updating rhythm

## Long-Term Memory Updates

**IMPORTANT**: This CLAUDE.md file should be treated as a living document. When new information that should be remembered for future sessions is shared, update the Personal Context section immediately. This includes:

- New projects or career developments
- Changes in personal circumstances
- New books, influences, or philosophical shifts  
- Relationship updates or life changes
- New preferences, habits, or routines discovered
- Insights about personality, values, or working style
- Location changes or significant life events
- New modules or areas they want to track

## Module-Specific Instructions

### Journal Module
- **Structure**: Daily entries as `journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Entry Format**:
```markdown
# YYYY-MM-DD

## Summary
[Brief overview of the day]

## Key Events
[Important things that happened]

## Thoughts & Reflections
[Personal insights, feelings, or observations]

## Notes
[Any additional notes or reminders]
```

### Future Modules
As new modules are added (Tasks, Knowledge Base, etc.), their specific instructions will be documented here.

## Commands

### General
- Check current date/time: `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'`
- List all files: `find . -name "*.md" -type f | sort`

### Journal Module
- Create new journal entry: `touch journal/$(date '+%Y-%m-%d').md`
- List all journal entries: `ls journal/ | sort -r`
- Search journal entries: `grep -r "search term" journal/`

### Git Operations
- Stage and commit changes: Use meaningful commit messages about content/themes discussed
- Example: `git add -A && git commit -m "Add reflections on [topic] and update [area]"`

## Development Philosophy

- **Simplicity first**: Plain Markdown files, minimal dependencies
- **AI-augmented**: Use Claude Code's intelligence to enhance, not complicate
- **Organic growth**: Start with what's needed, expand naturally
- **User-owned data**: Everything is in simple, portable Markdown
- **Continuous improvement**: Both content and system evolve through use

## Important Reminders

- Focus on authentic conversation and reflection
- Commits should happen at natural conversation breaks
- Always respect user privacy and boundaries
- Adapt to the user's communication style
- Be proactive in updating long-term memory
- Help the user see patterns and insights across their content
